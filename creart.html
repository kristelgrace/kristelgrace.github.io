        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          The livability of a city refers to the people’s expression of valuing
          a place. In this project, our team explored how public art, more
          specifically the public art co-creation process, could measurably
          improve the livability of a city. Public art co-creation is unfamiliar
          to many, yet there are numerous possibilities within this realm that
          could help foster qualities that make cities more livable. Through
          contextual interviews, think-alouds, and storyboarding and speed
          dating, we found that people need motivation to enjoy the outcome and
          experience of co-creating. They also value working in a synchronized
          environment, which also gives them the sense of building the community.
          For people to participate in the art co-creation process, there needs
          to be a low threshold for collaboration. Additionally, negative
          critique is feared by the general public, so it is important that
          this is blocked. With these insights in mind, our team developed the
          idea of CreArt, an application that uses AR to allow friends and
          family to co-create art with friends and families on top of existing
          landmarks around the city. AR will allow for users to maintain
          immersion, controlling experiencer attention and thus allow for
          co-creation to take part naturally, without any collision.

        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Research lead and user researcher</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          As the research lead of the team, I was primarily in charge of
          handling and organizing the data the team collects. I made sure
          that each data collected was complete and error-free. I made sure
          that collected data from interviews were ready for analyzing and
          synthesizing. <br><br>

          I was also a user researcher on the team, conducting and notetaking
          multiple interviews and discovering insights.

        <div class="small-htext text bold margin-up title" id="problem">Problem Space</div>
        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line italicize">
          How might we encourage the general public to take part in art
          co-creation project while feeling connected to the community and
          confident about expressing themselves?
        </p>
        <p class="norm-p-size text">
          Every form of art is very personal. Even community driven art is
          personal, but we still lack a system in which each individual
          creator can contribute in the creation process with lower
          threshold while enjoying themselves.

        <div class="small-htext text bold margin-up title" id="methods">Methods</div>
        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Contextual Inquiry</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          Our team interviewed five participants online to understand people’s
          attitude on public art in order to identify gaps or challenges and
          opportunities of the public art co-creation process. We asked
          semi-structured questions and probed interviewees to discover their
          feelings towards art. We then synthesized our results by conducting
          interpretation sessions for each interview and affinity diagramming.
          <br><br>
          This allowed us to learn more about the general public’s perspective
          on public art on accessibility and channels, hindrances for
          participating in the co-creation process, and their attitude on the
          overall co-creation process.
        </p>

        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Think-Alouds</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          Our team also conducted think-alouds on an art co-creation game
          online based on a card game,
          <a href=”https://kc-fakeartistonline.herokuapp.com” target=”_blank”>
            A Fake Artist Goes to New York</a>.
          The game divides players into artists and fake artists. Artists are
          given a word to draw, while fake artists guess the word. All players
          take turns and draw on a single canvas; we then gathered insights on
          users’ needs when collaborating. We synthesized our results using
          usability findings.

            <li>Users require low threshold to participate in co-creation.</li>
            <li>Users want to communicate with other visitors involved in the

        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Storyboarding and Speed Dating</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          After series of interviews, our team moved forward to proposing
          potential solutions to determine the needs of users. We first found
          five potential areas of need and created three comic-based stories
          for each area, totaling to fifteen storyboards. In the speed dating
          sessions, interviewees were presented with these storyboards and we
          probed them for their feelings towards each storyboard. <br><br>
          The storyboards and speed dating sessions revealed to us how we would
          be able to construct a solution to the problem space, as well as
          showing areas that should be prioritized over others.
        </p>

        <div class="small-htext text bold margin-up title" id="insights">Insights</div>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          From the previously stated user research methodologies, our team
          discovered the following insights:
        </p>
        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Motivation for Outcome and Process</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          People need motivation to enjoy the outcome and experience of
          co-creating. Friends and family members can also serve as motivation
          for people to participate in the art co-creation process. People also
          value the process more than the final product. <br><br>
          <span class="italicize">
            “I find the experience of creating most interesting...the outcome
            and the experience (process) of public art co-creation is also art.” <br>
          </span>
        </p>

        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Building the Community through Interactions</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          People value working in a synchronized environment, which also gives
          them the sense of building the community. Synchronized collaboration
          enables interactions among participants and inspires creativity
          through real-time communication. People have more chances to interact
          with each other and thus generate more creative ideas through
          synchronized collaboration.<br><br>
          <span class="italicize">
            “I feel a sense of similarity and community as people who are just
            trying to collaborate and create art.”<br>
            “It’s not meaningful if each person creates independently since
            there is no understanding of how to work together.” <br>
          </span>
        </p>

        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Low Threshold for Collaboration</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          There needs to be a low threshold for the art co-creation process for
          people to feel comfortable to participate in it. Each contributor
          should be able to express themselves alongside their friends and
          family, so they feel comfortable in this co-creation process. <br><br>
          <span class="italicize">
            “I feel motivated when I can express myself while contributing in
            the creation process.” <br>
          </span>
        </p>

        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Negative Critique Unwelcome</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          People fear negative critique, so it’s important that people are not
          exposed this; otherwise, they would not feel comfortable in creating
          public art. Since art is very personal, people also feel that art
          critique is personal. <br><br>
          <span class="italicize">
            “I’m scared of critique from other people, so I tend to only share
            my projects to a few people.”
          </span>
        </p>

        <div class="small-htext text bold margin-up title" id="solution">Solution</div>
        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">CreArt</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          In this project, we aimed to address the question: how might we
          encourage the general public to take part in art co-creation project
          while feeling connected to the community and confident about
          expressing themselves?<br><br>

          Our team proposed CreArt, a mobile app that allows users to co-create
          with their community and view other pieces of art in the city using
          augmented reality. We aimed to create an experience for users to build
          deeper connections with their community and with the city through
          public art that they and/ or other co-create. <br><br>

          This is a low fidelity prototype of CreArt.

        <div class="small-htext text bold title" id="reflection">Reflection</div>

        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Closing Thoughts</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          In this process, I learned numerous user research methods, such as
          contextual interviews, affinity diagramming, think-alouds, and
          storyboarding and speed dating. These methods were especially
          difficult to use and learn from in the face of social distancing and
          lockdown guidelines, so all of these methods were conducted online.
          In light of this, I learned how to work better with teammates online
          and be more analytical, especially in probing interviewees for
          insights and unique discoveries.

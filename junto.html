        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Problem</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          Along with the rise of technology, people are faced with an
          increasing amount of distractions as they try to do their work
          productively. Existing apps fail to incentivise users to stop
          procrastinating.
        </p>

        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Insight</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          Students procrastinate due to a wide variety of reasons, but a
          prevailing reason was to provide pleasure outside of academic stress.
          Students seek pleasure and begin to procrastinate to release stress.
        </p>

        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Outcome</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          We created a gamified task completion experience to combat
          procrastination. This is marketed as a productivity app and it
          leverages theories on psychology and design to increase a user’s
          pleasure surrounding their work.

        <div class="small-htext text bold margin-up title" id="solution">Solution</div>
        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">A Different Approach</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          Our team takes a different approach to procrastination than other
          productivity applications: rather than focusing on simply getting
          tasks done, we hope to make the environment surrounding the task more
          enjoyable through internal and external rewards to motivate users to
          accomplish their tasks.
        </p>

          <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Junto</p>
          <p class="text norm-p-size">
            Junto is an app that introduces rewards to users when they
            accomplish tasks; these rewards are presented in the form of
            unlocking and revealing mystery objects, collecting these objects,
            and placing these in a virtual world or augmented reality (AR).
            We also incorporated features to leverage social influences to
            reduce academic procrastination.
        </p>

        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Behind the Name Junto</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          The Junto (from the Spanish word for assembly - junta) was the name
          of a club that Benjamin Franklin formed in 1727. Benjamin Franklin,
          aside from being one of America’s Founding Fathers, was well known
          for his wit and famous phrases. Some of his best-known phrases have
          to do with combatting procrastination and making the most of one’s
          time. For example, Franklin is quoted to have said “never leave till
          tomorrow that which you can do today” and “you may delay, but time
          will not, and lost time is never found again.”

        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Unwrapping Animation of Gift Box</p>
        <p class="norm-p-size text">
          Law, Yin, Goh, Chen, Terry, & Gajos (2016) explored using curiosity
          itself as a way to motivate behavior. They found that curiosity
          could serve as a form of intrinsic motivation to incentivize
          crowdsource workers to complete more tasks, without negatively
          affecting performance. Junto uses curiosity as motivation and
          leverage insights from goal progress theory and self-regulation
          theory of goal striving by displaying a mystery gift box unwrap
          in stages as users complete tasks (see Figure 1). We also applied
          self-awareness theory by allowing users to enter into self-awareness
          when they see the box on the home screen. The box adjusts to the
          progress made, so users can clearly see if they are making progress
          based on the visual status of an unwrapped present. In designing
          the app, we intended for the progress to be encouraging for the user,
          such that they match their behavior to their desired outcome, to
          reveal the contents of the present by accomplishing their tasks.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Social Features</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          Research by Ferrari, Harriot, & Zimmerman (1997) has shown that
          anti-procrastination tendencies were correlated with higher levels
          of social satisfaction from peers and family. Lockwood and Pinkus
          (2008) have shown that social comparisons have the ability to change
          people’s goals and actions, and suggest that the continued presence
          of positive role models could have the ability to continually motivate
          one to achieve a difficult goal. Because course work could seem very
          daunting, we wanted to incorporate this social element into our game
          to motivate users to complete their goals. In Junto, users can view
          the objects that others in their social group have achieved (see
          Figure 2). Users can get a sense of how productive their friends are
          and can be motivated by others’ progress. Additionally, to enable
          friends to help each other out, we incorporated a “remind” feature
          where a user can remind their other friends to complete their tasks.
          This is an element of Junto that we did not extract from research,
          but this was implemented based on informal recommendations from user testing.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Augmented Reality</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          Ibáñez, Peláez, Jorge, & Delgado-Kloos (2019) experimented with using
          augmented reality as an incentive to overcome procrastination with
          positive results. Their experimental learning task was to require
          students to correctly answer 4 multiple choice questions in order to
          capture characters in AR. Our approach was to allow a user to display
          their already captured characters in AR, but we used Peláez, Jorge, &
          Delgado-Kloos’s research as a springboard to incorporating AR as a way
          to avoid procrastination, and we found positive effects from our user
          testing feedback.<br><br>
          By using AR, a user can see and interact with their object in “real
          life.” This was a way of making the prize more “real” after some
          early users felt a virtual prize would not be enough of a tangible
          reward to motivate them to complete tasks. This element also furthers
          the enjoyment aspect of Junto. This was one of the most popular
          elements of our user testing, and participants expressed their
          happiness and satisfaction with the cuteness of the item. In addition,
          users may view their collection of mystery objects in the virtual world.

        <div class="small-htext text bold title" id="theories">Theories Applied</div>
        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Gamification</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          Gamification has been defined as the use of “game-based mechanics,
          aesthetics, and game thinking to engage people, motivate action,
          promote learning, and solve problems.” (Kapp, 2012). Alsawaier (2018)
          conducted a literature review that included past research which has
          shown that gamification has fostered motivation and performance in a
          wide range of activities. Specifically, we wanted to incorporate
          gamification into our app to encourage our users to accomplish their
          goals and avoid procrastination. Junto involves making each
          individual tasks into a sort of game - users complete one task to
          unlock part of a prize.
        </p>

        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Outcome-Focused</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          In their paper, Kraus & Freund (2014) studied how rewards can deter
          procrastination. The act of procrastinating often serves as a reward
          by providing relief from stressful or undesired activity. In order to
          counteract how procrastination serves as a sort of inherent reward,
          Kraus & Freund demonstrated that when faced with an unpleasant task,
          shifting the focus from the task to the outcome can actually reduce
          procrastination. We incorporate elements of this approach by offering
          a type of reward for performing each task to shift some of the focus
          from the unpleasantness of the task to the ensuing reward. In Junto,
          completing a task provides immediate feedback in the form of a reward.
          The user will thus shift their focus from completing arduous tasks to
          unlocking the rewards.
        </p>

        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Self-Regulation Theories of Goal Striving</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          Wieber & Gollwitzer (2010) write that there are four problems that
          must be overcome for successful goal striving. First, people must
          overcome the initiation of action on a goal. In Junto, users can
          easily create tasks and sync tasks with a calendar like Canvas or
          Google Calendar. Second, people also have to overcome distractions
          and have to stay on track with the goal. To overcome this problem,
          Junto aims to increase the pleasure surrounding work or the situation
          surrounding work by enabling users to collect motivating mystery
          objects. Third, users must also disengage from failing courses of
          action. Failure to accomplish tasks should not hinder users from
          continuing progress with the goal. Junto aims to address this by
          providing motivation and pleasure that is enough to avoid
          counter-productive tasks. Fourth, people have to overcome the
          avoidance of overextension and ego depletion. To combat ego depletion,
          Junto allows users to review the amount of progress they have made
          through the collection page.
        </p>

        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Design Principles</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          The IBM Nudge Library also suggested design principles to use in order
          to achieve the desired behavior. Junto uses an appeal to emotions by
          designing cute mystery objects and implementing an easy user interface
          with light colors. Anticipation is built by having a slow reveal of
          the mystery object and only fully revealing it when all the tasks have
          been completed. Progress in tasks can be shown through the unwrapping
          of the present on the home screen. Habit cycle is formed by creating
          tasks (cue), completing tasks on time (action), and receiving a
          revealed mystery object (rewards).

        <p class="norm-p-size text bold remove-line">Closing Thoughts</p>
        <p class="text norm-p-size">
          By working on Junto, I learned a number of things, both from an
          academic and personal perspective. First, I learned to take
          constructive criticism and be quick to iterate on designs.
          Through user feedback and Professor Kaufman’s feedback, I saw how
          making changes based on these feedbacks significantly improved our
          application. Second, I learned how to apply design and psychological
          theories through games. This project enabled me to gain research
          skills and successfully apply theories to design, all the while
          making the game user-centered. Third, I learned how to work alongside
          people who were at different stages of life. Working with graduate
          students of the HCII has enabled me to communicate better and be more
          diligent with my work as well. Overall, this project was difficult
          given the quick timeline, but I really enjoyed it and I hope to
          continue building on this project in the future.
